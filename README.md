# Project-Management-SCE Room

This project is meant to make a room renting service for SCE students, as it stands it works only locally.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

have Node.JS installed on your computer.

### Installing

Download the project use the command: npm install on the directory.
Then run the file index.js (node index.js)
after that open a browser with the address 127.0.0.1:3000 the rest is via the site. 
We want the project to work online but that will happen in the future (hopefully).

## Running the tests

We initially wanted the project to have unit testing but there are no actual classes on the project so we did all the testing manually.

### And coding style tests

Coding style: if possible avoid using "var" use "let" or "const", no double brackets, function names cameCase, variables snake_case, Classes PascalCase.
We used ESlint to ensure the coding style persist between files.
